                <p>Hello, I am Allie Valder. I am 24 and new to coding. I graduated from the Univeristy of North Carolina at Charlotte in May of 2017. I have a dual Batchelors of Fine Arts in Ceramics and Art Education. I taught middle school art for a year and decided that teaching was simultaneously too draining and not challenging enough for me. I have always wanted to learn coding and love the problem solving and creative aspects that it offers.</p>
                <p>I have two cats, Xhena and Anders, whom are both rescues. Xhena is a 4 year old tortoise shell. she's the most loving kitty and will be your bestfriend if you have treats. Anders is  a 1 year old tabby. He is loving and spunky but thinks he owns the place. He is named after the character Anders from the Dragon Age videogame series.</p>
                <p>In my free time I enjoy playing videogames, working out, hiking, camping, watching movies and TV, and traveling when I can. I am an artist who specializes in ceramic sculptures and watercolor paintings. I am part of a D&D group where I play a half elf rougue named Iris.</p>
